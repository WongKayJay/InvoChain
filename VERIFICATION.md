## 🗄️ Database & State Management

### Implementation Status: ✅ **OPERATIONAL**

**Technology Used**: Provider Pattern with ChangeNotifier  
**File**: `lib/services/app_data_provider.dart` (368 lines)

### Verified Features:

#### Data Storage
- ✅ **Investment Opportunities**: 6 pre-loaded opportunities with full details
- ✅ **User Investments**: 2 sample investments with blockchain tracking
- ✅ **Invoices**: Complete invoice management system
- ✅ **Portfolio Data**: Real-time calculated statistics

#### Dynamic Updates (Interconnected Data)
```dart
✅ addInvestment() - Updates both user investments AND opportunity funding %
✅ addInvoice() - Creates new invoices with auto-generated IDs
✅ updateInvoiceStatus() - Changes invoice status with blockchain hash
✅ notifyListeners() - Triggers UI updates across all screens
```

#### Computed Properties (Auto-calculated)
- ✅ `totalPortfolioValue` - Sum of all investments + returns
- ✅ `totalInvested` - Total capital deployed
- ✅ `totalReturns` - Expected returns from all investments
- ✅ `activeInvestments` - Count of active positions
- ✅ `averageReturn` - Average ROI across portfolio
- ✅ `fundedInvoices` - Count of funded invoices
- ✅ `pendingInvoices` - Count of pending invoices

#### Integration Points
- ✅ `home_screen.dart` - Uses AppDataProvider for stats display
- ✅ `invest_screen.dart` - Reads opportunities, adds investments
- ✅ `portfolio_screen.dart` - Displays user investments with calculations
- ✅ `invoices_screen.dart` - Manages invoice lifecycle
- ✅ `main.dart` - Provides AppDataProvider to entire app tree

**Test Result**: All data flows verified, state updates propagate correctly ✅

## 🔐 Authentication & User Persistence

### Implementation Status: ✅ **OPERATIONAL**

**Technology Used**: SharedPreferences (Web-compatible)  
**File**: `lib/services/auth_service_web.dart` (306 lines)

### Verified Features:

#### User Storage
```dart
✅ SignUp - Creates users with hashed passwords (SHA-256)
✅ Login - Validates credentials from SharedPreferences
✅ Logout - Clears session data
✅ Persistence - Remembers login across app restarts
✅ checkLoginState() - Auto-login on app launch
```

#### Security Features
- ✅ **Password Hashing**: SHA-256 encryption
- ✅ **Email Validation**: Format checking
- ✅ **Duplicate Prevention**: Email uniqueness enforced
- ✅ **Session Management**: Persistent login state
- ✅ **User Data Structure**: ID, email, passwordHash, fullName, createdAt, lastLogin

#### Storage Mechanism
```dart
SharedPreferences Keys:
- 'users_db' → JSON map of all users
- 'logged_in_email' → Current user email
- 'is_logged_in' → Boolean session state
```

#### Integration Points
- ✅ `login_screen.dart` - Calls AuthServiceWeb.login()
- ✅ `signup_screen.dart` - Calls AuthServiceWeb.signUp()
- ✅ `profile_screen.dart` - Displays current user info
- ✅ `main.dart` - Checks login state on app start

**Test Result**: Authentication flow works, data persists correctly ✅
