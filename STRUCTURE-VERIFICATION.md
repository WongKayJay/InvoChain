## ✅ Benefits of New Structure

### 1. Better Organization
- All deployment files in one dedicated folder
- Clear separation: development vs deployment
- Easier to find specific files

### 2. Easy Access to Key Files
- `requirements.txt` and `built.txt` visible at root
- No need to dig through folders for dependencies
- Quick access to system design (`plan.txt`)

### 3. Cleaner Root Directory
- Less clutter in main folder
- Organized by purpose (frontend/, backend/, deployment/, docs/)
- Professional project structure

### 4. Improved Navigation
- deployment/ folder has its own README
- All related files grouped together
- Clear naming conventions

## 📊 File Count Summary

### Root Level
- Text files: 4 (.txt files)
- Documentation: 4 (.md files)
- Total: 8 easily accessible files

### deployment/ Folder
